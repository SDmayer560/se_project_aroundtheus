# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

**Description**

In this project I have made a small gallery of images from around the US. The primary goal of this project is to make a webpage that is adaptable to various screen sizes and devices. I have made this project adaptable by using the calc function, as well as percentages and the @media tag.
  
Good luck and have fun!
